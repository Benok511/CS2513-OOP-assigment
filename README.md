This is my assignment for my programming module where I had to use object oriented programming features to create anything I wanted. I chose to model my project on a game because I love
gaming and anything game related. I use encapsulation, Inheritance, composition, aggregation, properties to model my game where there are players and enemies fighting and lots of nice loot
to gain such as weapons and consumeables.

hope you enjoy my project 😄
