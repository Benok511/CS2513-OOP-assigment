This is my assignment for my programming module where I had to use object oriented programming features to create anything I wanted. I chose to model my project on a game because I love
gaming and anything game related. I use encapsulation, Inheritance, composition, aggregation, properties to model my game where there are players and enemies fighting and lots of nice loot
to gain such as weapons and consumeables.

Encapsulation is seen in every class to protect the instance variables and they are only accessed through getter and setter properties

My base classes are Character Item and Inventory all the rest of my classes Inherit from either Character or Item

hope you enjoy my project 😄
